            <p>With no title, no image information<br>and with the ISBN number as the<br>publisher’s name, this artist’s book creates an anonymous impression, which is enhanced by the understated design and the use of standard<br>paper and a standard printing process. The anonymity suits the serial nature<br>of the digitally drawn images by<br>Swiss artist Tobias Madison, as well<br>as their essential reproducibility.<br>As the images were printed from<br>digital data, they can never really be genuine originals, but neither are they mere copies – even in book form.</p>

            <p><em>Virginia Woolf — An exhibition inspired by her writings</em> is a catalog produced for the eponymous exhibition in TateSt Ives (February 10 – April 29, 2018).</p>
            <p>The graphic concept is based on the exhibition architecture : the catalog<br>is symmetrically structured, beginning with liberally full-bleed landscapes.<br>The deeper the viewer delves into<br>the physical exhibition, or the deeper the reader delves into the core of this book, the more intimate the subjects and works become. The print space reacts accordingly, contracting towards the middle of the book, as though<br>the contents sought protection in the<br>gutter margin. The offset white grounding used as an additional color for the catalog printing creates a spatial effect behind the isolated sculptural objects. The works presented in this book are surrounded in a similar manner by white traces of the drawings by France-Lise McGurn that were executed directly on the walls and around the works displayed in the exhibition.</p>

            <p><em>Do ré mi fa sol la si do</em> is the eponymous catalog to the first all-painting exhibition of Valentin Carron. All the motifs are modernist-inspired illustrations dating from the post-war era, culled from the covers and spines of industrially produced cloth or leather-bound books.</p>
            <p>What you see is what you get :<br>a metal frame covered with a plastic tarpaulin on which a mediocre motif has been halfheartedly hand-painted. All the reproductions in this catalog<br>are enlarged to fit the full page : the only indication of their varying sizes is the growing and shrinking diameters of the water pipes that form their frames.<br>The book is interspersed with views of the exhibition.</p>
            <p>The design of this catalog is based<br>on the layout and materials of the uniform straightforward format of Kunsthalle Bern’s exhibition catalogs from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s.</p>

            <p>Edited, designed and printed in India, the catalog for the Kochi-Muziris Biennale in Kerala is designed and produced locally. The represented participants – almost 100 in number – are organized in alphabetical order,<br>with the first name taking precedence as is customary in India. A register column at the margin as well as title pages for each letter, hand-folded in half a page, aid orientation. The short illustrated texts in English and Malayalam are set one below the other on each page, which along with the choice of font and typesetting gives<br>an impression of the two languages having equal weight.</p>
            <p>The book’s back matter comprises<br>a fold-out sequence of simplified maps of the exhibition sites on the outside, and various drone photos, Google<br>Arts & Culture renderings and isotropic architectural drawings – printed in four colors plus bronze – on the inside, highlighting various facets of the dilapidated former colonial trade houses that now serve as Bollywood film sets and Biennale exhibition sites.</p>

            <p><em>Polaroids</em> contains a selection of unpublished photographs from the personal archives of Swiss artist<br>and set designer H. R. Giger. Given the ephemeral nature of the Polaroid format, these are snapshots that<br>the artist used as references for his own work and as documentation<br>of his work process. Giger personalized many of the Polaroids by scratching, painting and drawing over the motifs in a surreal and animating style. This publication takes the form of a magazine, a light documentary format in keeping with the nature of Giger’s Polaroid collection. </p>

            <p>The images in this book are sequenced into visual chapters that purposefully subvert a standard chronological presentation. Instead, time bends to memory and association as people and scenes continually resurface and echo long after their initial introduction.</p>
            <p>Each chapter focuses on a<br>particular subject, with ample allowance for digressions, diversions and reoccurrences, before flowing without delineation into the next. In a similar<br>way, the book explores the fluid coexistence of photography within Sullivan’s work alongside his paintings and drawings. Established hierarchies between painting and photography, and between original and copy,<br>are undermined. </p>
            <p>Sullivan’s paintings and drawings can be challenging to reproduce accurately in print, due to his frequent use of fluorescent, iridescent and “luminous” hues that fall outside the standard CMYK printing gamut.<br>By using a special color profile of three Pantone “neon” inks plus black, this volume aims to restore Sullivan’s color spectrum and to fully translate his work’s vibrant intensity to the page.</p>

            <p>Appenzellers have been colorfully painting their houses for roughly two centuries now. The paint is not primarily for weatherproofing purposes, but<br>an adornment whose roots lie deep in the region’s sociocultural legacy.<br>The six – and exactly six – colors used in Appenzell range from a deep dark red,<br>a sweet shade of lilac, turquoise and light blue to a warm shade of ocher and off-yellow, which are blended intuitively, by feel, by those who have inherited<br>and learned the craft from their forbears. The traditional appellations<br>or “color codes” for these hues are,<br>respectively, <em>Roschtroot, Sennegood Violett, Sennegood Grüe, Appezölleblau, Rehbru, and Gadegeel</em>.</p>
            <p>This booklet shows the ruins of alpine huts around Lake Seealp, offset printed in the typical colors of Appenzell<br>Inner-rhoden farm houses. The colors were mixed in the color tanks of the press during the printing process by one of the two last remaining professional practitioners of this traditional métier.</p>

            <p>This book introduces the reader to novel ways of depicting large cities using screenshots from the Apple Maps system program. Seen from close up, however, the seemingly film-like, realistic images often look like blurred paintings, and the book’s design<br>takes this effect to an extreme, with extra-large reproductions of the screenshots seamlessly aligned one after the other. The digital source material is offset printed using ANIVA colors, a new type of highly pigmented ink with clearly extended color spaces. A profusion of disturbing details emerges, opening up an intermediate sphere between realistic depiction<br>and poetic presentation. The book gives a material quality and permanence to<br>a virtual pictorial world.</p>

            <p>This book, made in close collaboration with the artist, directly addresses his working process and translates it into book format. Eisenring uses oddments and casts of industrial metal plates<br>in relief print, enhancing the resultant abstract forms with digital or colored-pen drawings or engravings. In the same vein, earlier reproductions are<br>overlaid here with blind stamps, forming templates in which to set new drawings. 
            </p><p>Cédric Eisenring’s show blurs the divide between the notional space created by the works themselves and the real space in which they are displayed. So, too, in this book,<br>in which the relief print and 28 gate-folds open up fictionalized spaces, adding a narrative level to the printed material.</p>
            <p>This publication serves as a catalog<br>to the <em>Cédric Eisenring</em> exhibition at<br>the Aargauer Kunsthaus (held January 27 – April 15, 2018), but also as a stand-alone artist’s book.</p>
