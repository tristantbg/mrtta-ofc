As the images were printed from digital data, they can never really be genuine originals, but neither are they mere copies – even in book form.</p> <p>Despite all the play with reproducibility and anonymity, however, the graphic aesthetic of the images remains very much its own and gives the book a strong identity.

The&nbsp;deeper the viewer delves into the physical exhibition, or the deeper the reader delves into the core of this book, the more intimate the subjects and works become. The&nbsp;print space reacts accordingly, contracting towards the middle of the book, as though the contents sought protection in the gutter margin. The&nbsp;offset white grounding used as an additional color for the catalog printing creates a spatial effect behind the isolated sculptural objects. The&nbsp;works presented in this book are surrounded in a similar manner by white traces of the drawings by France-Lise McGurn that were executed directly on the walls and around the works displayed in the exhibition.</p> </div> <div class="infos"> <div class="inner"> <div class="top"> <div>Virginia Woolf — An exhibition inspired by her writings</div> <div>2018</div> </div> <div class="middle"> <div>Exhibition catalog</div> <div>Paperback with flap</div> <div>20.5 x 26 cm. 224 pages</div> <div>978-184976-59-85</div> </div> <div class="bottom"> <div>Tate Publishing, London (UK)</div> <div>Musumeci S.p.A., Quart (AO).

Instead, time bends to memory and association as people and scenes continually resurface and echo long after their initial introduction. Each chapter focuses on a particular subject, with ample allowance for digressions, diversions and reoccurrences, before flowing without delineation into the next. In a similar way, the book explores the fluid coexistence of photography within Sullivan’s work alongside his paintings and drawings. Established hierarchies between painting and photography, and between original and copy, are undermined.</p><p>Sullivan’s paintings and drawings can be challenging to reproduce accurately in print, due to his frequent use of fluorescent, iridescent and “luminous” hues that fall outside the standard CMYK printing gamut. By using a special color profile of three Pantone “neon” inks plus black, this volume aims to restore Sullivan’s color spectrum and to fully translate his work’s vibrant intensity to the page.</p> </div> <div class="infos"> <div class="inner"> <div class="top"> <div>Billy Sullivan.

The&nbsp;paint is not primarily for weatherproofing purposes, but an adornment whose roots lie deep in the region’s sociocultural legacy. The&nbsp;six – and exactly six – colors used in Appenzell range from a deep dark red, a sweet shade of lilac, turquoise and light blue to a warm shade of ocher and off-yellow, which are blended intuitively, by feel, by those who have inherited and learned the craft from their forbears. The&nbsp;traditional appellations or “color codes” for these hues are, respectively, <em>Roschtroot, Sennegood Violett, Sennegood Grüe, Appezölleblau, Rehbru, and Gadegeel</em>.</p> <p>This booklet shows the ruins of alpine huts around Lake Seealp, offset printed in the typical colors of Appenzell Innerrhoden farm houses. The&nbsp;colors were mixed in the color tanks of the press during the printing process by one of the two last remaining professional practitioners of this traditional métier.</p> </div> <div class="infos"> <div class="inner"> <div class="top"> <div>Barbara Signer.
