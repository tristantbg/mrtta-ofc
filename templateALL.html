        <p>Text : Edited, designed and printed in India, the catalog for the Kochi-Muziris Biennale in Kerala is designed and produced locally. The represented participants – almost 100 in number – are organized in alphabetical order, with the first name taking precedence as is customary in India. A register column at the margin as well as title pages for each letter, hand-folded in half a page, aid orientation. The short illustrated texts in English and Malayalam are set one below the other on each page, which along with the choice of font and typesetting gives an impression of the two languages having equal weight. Lastly, a fold-out sequence with simple plans of the exhibition sites on the outside and a diversity of drone photos, « Google Arts and Culture »-renderings and architectural isotropic drawings – printed in four colours plus bronze – on the inside. Highlighting various facets of the decaying former colonnial trade houses which serve as Bollywood film sets and the Biennale’s exhibiton spaces.</p>
